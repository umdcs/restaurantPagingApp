RESTAURANT PAGING APPLICATION
        The Restaurant Paging app is designed to eliminate the use of standard pager based paging systems and provide customers with a more convenient method of communication with their restaurant of choice.
 	Our focus for this semester was to create a distributed application that allows the client to add, edit, remove a reservation and allow the customer to add and remove their own reservations.
 	
 	This application was conceptualized and designed by University of Minnesota Duluth students in the CS4531 course under the supervision of Professor Pete Willemsen. 
 	
 	The application is fully functional and ready for general use. The intedned custmers will need to have a SIM card and cellular plan inorder to use utilize the SMS capabilities.
